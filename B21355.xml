            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE TRANSLATOR TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>MY deſign in tranſlating this ſmall work from one of our Authors, is not to pretend to add to the ſtile of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> writings, to the compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs whereof nothing can be added.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Divines are ſo great Maſters of Scripture, that one would think they ſtudy nothing elſe: not in the manner that ſome <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Doctors learn the <hi>Alcoran</hi> by heart or rote; but ſo underſtand holy Letters, that it may be ſaid they have perfectly the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of <hi>Canaan.</hi> To preſent the <hi>Engliſh</hi> therefore with any thing for Scripture
<pb facs="tcp:204611:3"/> ſake, there ſeems no great reaſon, for they want Quotations no more than Explanation: however, it is one of the reaſons that moves me to preſent them with this Tranſlation.</p>
            <p>I know not whether it be my Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or a right Obſervation; but me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, that among the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſms there is none ſo fit for the publick as this: For, as the publick contains all ſorts of capacities, a work of this kind ought to be for them all, ſince a Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm is for the whole, without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and in my opinion this is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably fit for that purpoſe. It hath ſomething to raiſe the curioſity of more than common capacities, by entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with ſome Doctrines it doth not teach, and that without racking the common ones, by any thing that ſhould leave them unſatisfied, ſince it anſwers the objections of thoſe different Doctrine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:204611:3"/> genius of the generality: nor in its ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is it defective; for it contains not only what is neceſſary to ſerve a good Chriſtian, but a good Proteſtant too. Its anſwers are powerful, ſince they all allow nothing but pure Texts of the word of God: and in few words doth ſo much, that every where it bears the Image of the only word, whereby all things were made; all theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have made me think that it may be ſerviceable to this Nation, eſpecially to Youth, whom the Author made it for, as may be ſeen in his Epiſtle; many in <hi>France</hi> being made to learn it, before they have admittance to the Lord's Supper. It may be no leſs uſeful for People of mature years; eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the ordinary ſort, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they know the Church Catechiſm, may be admitted to the higheſt My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of God's Worſhip; for ſometimes they know not what God is whom they ſerve, and whether there be more than one, as I have known it by experience.

               <salute>My dear Children,</salute>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Thought my hour was come to go from this World to the Father of Spirits; although I love you with all tenderneſs imaginable, I was wholly reſigned to the Will of God, and was wholly diſpoſed to put my Soul in the hands of that Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Creator. But he hath taken pity of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and hath given me again to your Tears; I believe he hath reſtored me to life again, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally that I may inſtruct you in the knowledge of him, and that I may teach you to walk in his ways. Wherefore as ſoon as I began to breathe, I have dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this Catechiſm for you, to the end that when it ſhall pleaſe God to receive me into his Reſt, I may end my days with that contentment, to have given you this witneſs of my ardent affection for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb facs="tcp:204611:5"/> of your Souls, and to have ſeen before your eyes a ſummary of the things you ought to believe, and what you ought to do to attain Eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pineſs; I know very well that others have happily worked on the ſame ſubject, and I do affect No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty ſo little, that every where, where it was poſſible for me, and that my Memory ſuggeſted to me, I have followed the beaten highway, and kept cloſe to the order of the Catechiſm, that we expound in the Aſſembly of the Faithful, to the end that the publick Inſtruction and Domeſtick ones be equally familiar to you; but I hope of your good nature, that you will embrace with more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, what is preſented to you from your Fathers hands; That you will take more pleaſure to pleaſe him, and to obey him in ſo just and reaſonable a thing; the fruit whereof you ſhall receive. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you may learn exactly the Chriſtian Inſtruction, that it be always on your Lips, and that it be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graved in your Hearts that you meditate on it day and night, and that you confirm thereunto your Life and Manners, leſt you ſhould be doubly Chaſtized, as the unfaithful Servant, who knows the will of his Maſter and doth it not, or to bring upon you the malediction of Heaven, as the evil ground which often drinks the Rain, and however produces nothing, but Thorns and Thiſtles. The more you have received, the more ſhall be required from you; repreſent unto your ſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing, the grace wherewith God favoured you; to have cauſed you to be born in his Church,
<pb facs="tcp:204611:5"/> in this great light of the Goſpel, and to have given you all the neceſſary helps to form you to virtue, to bear Fruit worthy of your Birth, and of your Education; anſwer my cares and my hopes: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member your Creator in the days of your Infancy, and of your Youth; Conſecrate to his glory the firſt fruits of your life; and offer him the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of your Age. Take care to pray to God morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and evening, and every hour of the day, and to give him thanks for all the good you receive continually of his liberal hand; let the fear of him be always before your Eyes, and whereſoever you be, think that God looks upon you, and walk before his face in purity, and innocency.</p>
            <p>Know that the greateſt Woe that may befall you in the VVorld, is to offend ſo good a Father, and ſo merciful a Saviour; and that your greateſt Felicity, and greateſt Glory is to ſerve him, and obey him; abhor all ſorts of Vices, and eſpecially that of lying; which is a vice ſervile and proper to the Children of the Devil; who is a Lyar and a Murtherer from the beginning. Be not quarelſome, be not moved for ſlight matters; be more ſenſible for every thing that concerns the glory of God, than for your particular Intereſts.</p>
            <p>Deſpiſe Injuries, appeaſe wrath by the ſweetneſs of your words, do not ill offices to any, overcome evil with good, take pleaſure to ſerve every one, and do not be ſlow to employ your ſelves for others; be affable and meek, be modeſt and adorn your ſelves with humility; for God reſiſts the proud, but gives grace to the humble.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:204611:6"/>
            <p>Frequent thoſe whom you would reſemble, and avoid the company of Debaucht perſons, for evil Communication corrupts good Manners; bear with one another, and lend one another a helping hand; love one another cordially, and be you all ſenſible of every evil, and every good that befals you, as if you were all animated by one and the ſelf ſame Spirit, for it is a good thing, and a pleaſing thing, not only to good people, but to God himſelf, to ſee Brothers united, and tyed together by the bonds of a holy Love, and of a perfect Charity, by Peace and Concord, the ſmalleſt things encreaſe; but by diſcord and quarrels the greateſt and moſt flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing are reduced to nothing.</p>
            <p>Obſerve, your life runs inſenſibly, as a flower which paſſes away as ſoon as it is blown, and as a Flambeux which burns as ſoon as it begins to give light. Think early on Immortality, and ground your hopes in Heaven, where God reſerves for you an Inheritance incorruptible.</p>
            <p>The years fly away, the World paſſes away, and the luſt thereof; all that is under the Sun is nothing but vanity and vexation of Spirit. The whole Duty of Man is to fear God, and keep his Commandments.</p>
            <p>Let nothing be able to withdraw you from the ſervice of God, nor from the open profeſſion of his Truth; let not the threatnings of the World fright you, nor its promiſes allure you, and follow not its evil example.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:204611:6"/>
            <p>None can threaten you with any puniſhment, which is comparable to the Torments of Hell, and to the Eternal flames, wherein God ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate the fearful, and none can promiſe you any thing that ought to be preferred to the delights of Paradice; for him who fears God there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to fear, and for him who poſſeſſes him there remains nothing to wiſh for, for God is the ſpring and the height of true felicity.</p>
            <p>If God takes me to himſelf before you are come to an age perfect, do not loſe courage, you have a Father in Heaven who is Immortal, and who loves you with an Eternal Love, he will take you in the Arms of his Providence, and will carry you upon his Wings, he will keep you as the Apple of his Eye, and will bleſs you with all his moſt precious bleſſings; we can do nothing without him; but he can do every thing without us; I bleſs you in words, but he will bleſs you in deeds; and wiſh you a happy life filled with bleſſings; but every excellent grace, and every perfect gift is from above, and comes from the Father of Light.</p>
            <p>I don't beg of him to ſend you earthly Riches, nor worldly Honors; but that he will move you with the ſpirit of his fear; that he will embrace you with his Love, that he may engrave in your Hearts the Image of his Holineſs, and that he give you grace to perſevere conſtantly in his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and edifie his Church by your Piety and your holy Converſation, to the end that I may ſay
<pb facs="tcp:204611:7"/> to him, Behold I, Lord, and the Children thou haſt given me for a ſign and a wonder in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> That having ſeen you here below filled with his graces, and covered with his protection, I may ſee you above in Heaven, cloathed with his Glory, and Crowned with his Immortality.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the moſt ardent Vows and Wiſhes of your Father, who loves you, becauſe you are his Children; but who loves <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>A.</hi> It ſignifies the Reckoning, or the ſhare that every one pay of a common Meal. It ſignifies alſo the Scarf and the Livery, whereby one knows the Soldiers of an Army, or of a Company.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why do you call it the Symbol of the Apoſtles?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is not that the Apoſtles, the one after the others, have inſerted in it any particular clauſe, but becauſe it is an Epitome of their Doctrine; it is alſo the Scarf and the Livery of Chriſtianity.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> 'Tis proved by ſeveral Reaſons that there is but one only God, who hath made all things, and was made of none; and who moves all things, without moving himſelf: but the Revelations alone teaches us, that in that Unity of Eſſence, there is a Trinity of Perſons.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>In what paſſage of the Scripture is it ſpoken of?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> In the 28th Chapter of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt's Goſpel according to St. <hi>Matthew: Teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, of the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And in the 5th Chapter of the firſt Epiſtle of St. <hi>John, There are three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, and theſe three are one.</hi>

                        <hi>A.</hi> There are two ſorts of Images, ſome are made to repreſent the Creator, and the others to be the Effigies of the Creatures, theſe to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the Creator are abſolutely forbidden.</p>
                     <p>Q. <hi>What proof have you thereof?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> It is impoſſible to have a clearer one, or more convincing, than that of the 4. Chapt. of <hi>Deut.</hi> Take you therefore good heed unto your ſelves, (for ye ſaw no manner of ſimilitude on the day that the Lord ſpake unto you in <hi>Horeb,</hi> out of the midſt of the fire) Leſt you cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt your ſelf, and make you a graven Image, the ſimilitude of any figure, the likeneſs of Male or Female, and in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the 40. To whom then will you liken God? or what likeneſs will ye compare unto him: wherefore God puts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the greateſt ſins of the Antient Heathens, that of having changed the glory of the Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible God into an Image made like to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible.

                     <p>Q. <hi>What do you ſay of the Imag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> The Images of the Creatures are of two uſes, the one Political and Civil, and the other Sacred and Religious. The civil uſe of Images is not forbidden, and there may be ſome to ſerve for Ornament and for Memorial; but God will not have them be employed for his
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:204611:30"/> worſhip, and in regard of that he ſaith, Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelf any graven Image, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Q <hi>But did not God command</hi> Moſes <hi>to make gold Cherubims, and to ſet them on the mercy ſeat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> He who makes the Law is above the Law, God doth not ſay, I who am your Lord and your God will never make any graven Image, but he ſaith, thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelf, that is to ſay, of thine head, and of thine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention; beſides thoſe Cherubims were only ſymbolical figures of the vertue and offices of Angels, and were not expoſed to the peoples view; ſo that there was no danger of Idolatry thereby.</p>
                     <p>Q. <hi>Did not</hi> Moſes <hi>make a Brazen Serpent which he did ſet up in the Wilderneſs.</hi> Numb. 21.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> Yes, but he did not make it of himſelf, God expreſly commanded it, he did not ſet up that Serpent to be worſhipped, but only to be ſeen, and when afterward the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> committed Idolatry, and burnt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe unto it, the King <hi>Ezechias</hi> did break it in pieces, and ſaid it was but a piece of braſs. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.</p>
                     <p>Q <hi>But if we did meet with thoſe who have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration for Images, ſhould we do ill, if to have peace with them, we did accommodate our ſelves to their Worſhip?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> Yes moſt aſſuredly, for God doth not only forbid to make Images to employ them to his Worſhip, but in caſe that there be ſome made, he forbids us to proſtrate our ſelves before them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nd to worſhip them.</p>
                     <p>Q. <hi>Thoſe of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>do they ſin againſt this Divine Ordinance?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:204611:31"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> Yes, moſt viſibly: for they ſet in their Temples all ſorts of Images, they put them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Altars, and render them the honour which God forbids; they pull off their Hats to them, they bow to them; they kiſs them, and kneel before them; that is directly againſt the formal words of this Law, thou ſhalt not bow down to them; beſides, they dreſs them up, they crown them with Flowers, they light Candles to them, they burn Incenſe to them; they carry them upon their Shoulders in proceſſions, and they go unto them in Pilgrimages; all which is againſt what is ſaid, thou ſhalt not worſhip them.</p>
                     <p>Q. <hi>Why is that God calls himſelf jealous?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> To ſpeak properly, it is not that God has the paſſion of jealouſy which troubles men, but by that he will reach us firſt, that he loves us ardently; ſecondly, that he cannot bear a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, nor his Glory to be given to another; thirdly, that he will puniſh rigorouſly all Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters.</p>
                     <p>Q <hi>Why is it that in the threatning of his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he mentions but three or four Generations, but that he ſtretches his promiſe of Graces and Mercy unto thouſands.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> To ſhew us that he is more inclined to be merciful than to exerciſe vengeance, ſo that the ſaying of St. <hi>James</hi> may be applied to him, that Mercy rejoyceth over Judgment, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.</p>
                     <p>Q: <hi>But doth God puniſh all the Children of the wicked?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> If the Children of the wicked follow the way of their Father, God will puniſh them two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, becauſe of the criminal life of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:204611:31"/> but if they repent and live in the fear of God, the ſins of their Fathers ſhall not be imputed to them, for the Father ſhall not bear the iniquity of the Son, and the Son ſhall not bear the iniquity of the Father, but the Soul of him that ſineth, is that which ſhall dye, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.</p>
                     <p>Q. <hi>And doth God pour down his Graces upon all the Children of the faithful?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> Yes, upon all thoſe who imitate the Piety of their Fathers; nay, have a twofold bleſſing of all ſorts of bleſſings; but as to thoſe who turn aſide from it, and who give themſelves to do evil, they bring upon them the wrath of God and his juſt vengeance.</p>
                     <p>Q. <hi>Can you tell what is the deſign of this ſecond Commandment, and what God demands of us therein?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> The ſame which our Lord Jeſus Chirſt teaches us, in <hi>John</hi> 4. that the Father will have true worſhippers, who worſhip him in ſpirit and truth. God is a Spirit, and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in Spirit and in Truth.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> To teach us to be content with what is neceſſary, without begging of him what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful; or to uſe them ſoberly, and with thankſgiving, if through his liberality he gives them us.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe all our labour is uſeleſs without the bleſſing of God, who enriches or impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes when it pleaſes him.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> To teach us to rely on his providence, and on his paternal care; and to oblige us to call upon him every day.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> He forbids not the care of an holy fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt: Contrarily he ſends us to the School of Ants, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 6. Go to the Ant, thou ſluggard, conſider her ways and be wiſe.

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:204611:44"/> but he condemns the care of miſtruſt, ſuch as that of the Heathens, who ſay, what ſhall we eat, what ſhall we drink, or what ſhall we put on. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>But rich men, who have riches ready heaped for many years, ought they to beg that of God?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes: for it is not enough to have riches in abundance, if God gives us not the uſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and man liveth not of bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> By faith, who really embraces him unto Salvation, for he that comes to him ſhall never hunger, and he that believeth on him ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thirſt, <hi>John</hi> 6. and thro the efficacy of his Spirit, who really uniteth us to him, for we have been made to drink into one ſpirit, to be one body with him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>May not this Communion be made without the uſe of the Sacraments?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes; for Jeſus Chriſt had not yet inſtituted the Lords Supper, when he ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 6. he that eats my fleſh and drinks my blood, dwelleth in me and I in him.</p>
                  <p>Q <hi>Of what uſe then is the Lords Supper to us, and what have we more therein, than when by Faith and Repentance, we receive in our hearts Jeſus Chriſt ſanctified?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> We recieve therein the external ſymbol and ſeal of our ſpiritual communion; for to confirm our faith, God uſeth to ſeal outwardly his Grace to us. So after <hi>Abraham</hi> believed God, and after it was counted unto him for righteouſneſs, he received the ſign of Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for a ſeal of the Righteouſneſs of the Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. So <hi>Cornelius</hi> was baptized after having received the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Act</hi> 10. All the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets give witneſs to Jeſus Chriſt that through
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:204611:53"/> his name, whoſoever believes in him ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive remiſſion of ſins, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. but that hinders not of baptizing in the name of Jeſus Chriſt in remiſſion of ſins, becauſe Baptiſm is the ſeal of that remiſſion of ſins, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>In the celebration of that Myſtery, muſt not one ſacrifice Jeſus really and properly?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No, for he commanded us to eat his fleſh, and to drink his blood, and not to offer him in ſacrifice. He through the eternal ſpirit offered himſelf without ſpot to God, and by that ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice he acquired eternal Redemption for us, and he hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>But is he not ſtill offered every day in the Maſs, by the hands of the Prieſts in an unbloody manner, in propiciatory ſacrifice, for the remiſſion of the ſins of the quick and the dead?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Quite contrary, St <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that without ſhedding of blood is no remiſſion, that Jeſus Chriſt offered not himſelf ſeveral times, for then muſt he have ſuffered ſeveral times ſince the foundation of the world, and that where is remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion of ſins, there is no offering for ſin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Muſt Sacraments be adored?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No, for Jeſus Chriſt did not command it, and the Apoſtles have not ſhewed us the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thereof. Our Lord doth not ſay, do you behold and adore, but take and eat; and the Apoſtles did take and did eat what was given them, but did not adore it.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Ought the Paſtors to adminiſter the Cup to the people?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes; for our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſpeaking to his Apoſtles, which repreſented his Church,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:204611:54"/> ſaid to them, drink ye all of it: for this is my blood of the new Teſtament, which is ſhed for many for the remiſſion of ſins, <hi>Matt.</hi> 26. and St <hi>Paul,</hi> let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup, <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How ought we to examine our ſelves?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> We muſt enter our Conſciences, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our ſelves, to know if we have Faith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and Charity.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is Faith?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A</hi> It is a recourſe of the ſinful and penitent Soul, to the mercy of God in Chriſt Jeſus, and a ſure truſt, that for this glorious Saviour's ſake he will forgive us our ſins, and will receive us into his heavenly Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is Repentance?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is a ſenſible grief to have offended our heavenly Father: and a fervent deſire for time to come to glorify him in all our actions, our words, and our thoughts.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How many parts are there in true repentance?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Two: for we muſt ceaſe to do evil, and learn to do well; depart from evil and do good; to abhor that which is evil, cleave to that which is good, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 1. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Rom</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is Charity?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is to love God with all our heart, and our Neighbour as our ſelves.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is not only becauſe I have had the happineſs to be born, educated and brought up in it; but alſo becauſe through the grace of God I know that it is the true Chriſtian Religion, that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt brought from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that his holy Apoſtles have preached, and his happy Martyrs have ſigned with their blood.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How do you know that?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I know it by the reading of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for we believe nothing at all of what is neceſſary to Salvation, that is not clearly and expreſly found in that Scripture divinely inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: or cannot be drawn therefrom by evident and neceſſary conſequences.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Hath Chriſtian Religion had, or can it have need of Reformation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Not in conſidering it ſuch as 'tis in it ſelf; for in that regard it is wholly divine.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Why then is it called the Reformed Religion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Properly ſpeaking, it is not the Religion, but the Church which was Reformed: that is to ſay, that was purged from the errors and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:204611:64"/> that through Ignorance and Malice of men it had been defiled with.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That it is true and pure Chriſtianity, ſuch as is taught in the Goſpel, and which is ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from all human traditions and inventions. For our Lord abſolutely condemns them in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his worſhip, in vain, ſaith he, do you wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip me, teaching for doctrines the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men. <hi>Matt.</hi> 15.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe it adores the Sacrament, and renders to a ſimple Creature the Honour and the Glory that belongs only to God. It pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to Sacrifice Jeſus Chriſt in Propitiatory Sacrifice, for the remiſſion of the ſins, of the quick and of the dead: although that great God and Saviour did not command it, and that his Apoſtles have done nothing like it; it bereaves the faithful of the bleſſed Cup, that our Lord commanded us to drink in remembrance of him. It teaches another Purgatory than the precious blood of that glorious Redeemer, which cleanſes us from all Sin: and hath the Divine Service in a tongue that the People underſtand not; againſt what the Apoſtles orders in the firſt to the <hi>Cor.</hi> c. 14.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> There are ſeveral other reaſons which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders me for ever to participate of its Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for it adheres to, and obeys the Pope, who uſurped an authority and power which belongs to God only. It believes that we are ſaved through the merit and dignity of our works, though the Goſpel teaches quite contrary. It invokes the Saints, although in all the word of God there is neither Commandment or Example thereof. It adores material Croſſes and Relicks, and renders to Angels a Religious worſhip; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt what is commanded to adore and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God alone. They bow to Images, and worſhip them Religiouſly; againſt what God expreſly forbids in his Law. It hath invented an infinite number of holy days, that are dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and Conſecrated unto Creatures: inſtead of which God permits us to work ſix days of the week;<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> a thing amongſt thoſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, which they wear about their Necks.</note> and that he will not have us give his glory to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It condemns Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical perſons Marriage; inſtead of what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles teach, that Marriage and the undefiled bed is honourable among all. It commands at ſome certain times to abſtain from meats that God permits, provided one uſe them with ſobriety and thankſgiving. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, it hath veneration for the Jubilees, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> the holy Beads and Chaplets, and numbers of other things, which are vain and ſuperſtitious.</p>

               <p>Q. <hi>But could not you ſave your ſelf in believing in your heart what we believe, and living however in the outward profeſſion of the Church of</hi> Rome?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By no means, for with the heart Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth unto Righteouſneſs, and with the mouth Confeſſion is made unto Salvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. God will be glorified in our bodies, and in our ſpirits, becauſe they belong to him, and that he equally redeems them. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. Our Lord will deny before God his Father, and his Angels, whomſoever ſhall deny him before men; one muſt be cold or hot, for the luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm he ſpues out of his mouth. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. in fine it is an infalliable truth, that all thoſe ſhall not inherit the kingdom of Heaven, who ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Creatures the honour and glory that belongs but to the Creator. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But do you not well ſee that in perſevering in Religion, you ſhall be hated and perſecuted by the World?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Our Lord foretold it. If the World hateth you, ſaith he, you know that it hated me before it hated you: if ye were of the World, the world would love his own; but becauſe ye are not of the World, but I have choſen you out of the World, wherefore the World hateth you. <hi>John</hi> 15. Bleſſed are they which are perſecuted for righteouſneſs ſake; for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven. <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Do you promiſe then before God and his holy Angels, to live and die in that true and holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, whereof through the grace and mercy of God, ye make profeſſion?</hi>

                  <hi>A.</hi> I promiſe it with all my heart, and I hope that God will give me the aſſiſtance of his Spirit, with ſo much efficacy, that all the Worlds promiſes and threatning, ſhall never make me turn aſide from ſo Chriſtian and ſo neceſſary a Reſolution.</p>

               <p>REmember that it is to God that you make this promiſe, and that one day you muſt give him an account, when you ſhall appear before his Throne. My Child, do not hearken to the Seducers, who make traffick of Souls: do not keep evil Companies, who corrupt good manners: do not follow ill Examples; and though it ſhould be an Angel from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that ſhould preach to you beyond what is in the Goſpel, let him be accurſed. Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate your ſelf wholly unto the Service of him who gave himſelf for you, and who redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you by his own blood. Laſtly, pray to God with holy fervency that he encreaſe your Faith, fortify your Hope, inflame your Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and your zeal for his Glory. Pray to him to ſanctify you through his Spirit, to form you unto his Image, and to give you grace conſtantly to perſevere in his holy Covenant. For he who to the end ſhall perſevere, ſhall be ſaved, and ſhall poſſeſs and inherit the
